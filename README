Command awsns creates/updates A/CNAME records for given DNS zone in AWS
Route 53 for all running non-spot ec2 instances based on their "Name" tag.

It can be run manually with -zone flag set to hosted zone ID and -suffix set
to suffix to construct domain names from. Domain names constructed by
concatenating value of the "Name" instance tag with suffix value set by
-suffix flag.

I.e. if ec2 instance tag "Name" is set to "jenkins" and program is called
with -suffix=".foo.example.com", then constructed name would be
jenkins.foo.example.com. Zone ID must match either example.com or
foo.example.com zone in Route 53 console.

Program may remove existing A/CNAME records matching given suffix if no
corresponding non-spot ec2 instances found running.

If ec2 instance has public DNS name, program creates CNAME record pointing
to such name, otherwise it creates A record pointing to public IP address.

Program may also be run as AWS Lambda invoked by CloudWatch event created as
"EC2 Instance State-change Notification" for "running" state. It then looks
up suffix and zone id in SUFFIX and ZONE environment variables. Lambda needs
permissions to describe EC2 instances and list/update Route 53 records;
required permissions can be satisfied by using the following AWS managed
policies: AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, AmazonRoute53FullAccess,
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole.
